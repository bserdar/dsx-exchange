# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## Repository overview

DSX Exchange is a monorepo for the DSX event bus: AsyncAPI schemas, NATS auth-callout service (Go), Helm charts, Fern docs site, and a Kind-based local evaluation framework.

## Build and test

```bash
make check                     # license headers + unit tests + helm lint
make test                      # unit tests only (no cluster required)
make test-e2e                  # requires Kind clusters (see local/)
make -C auth-callout test      # auth-callout unit tests
helm lint deploy/nats-event-bus
helm lint auth-callout/deploy
```

Local Kind e2e deploys and functional tests must run outside the sandbox. The
local e2e path builds Docker images, updates Docker buildx state under
`~/.docker`, loads images into Kind, and starts `kubectl port-forward` processes
for NATS and Keycloak. In the sandbox this has failed with Docker buildx
permission errors and host-side Keycloak timeouts. Use the local Make targets
with unsandboxed execution, for example `make -C local deploy-nats` and
`make -C local test-functional`.

## Commit conventions

Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). CI enforces this via commitlint.

```
type(scope): short description
```

Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.

All commits must include a DCO sign-off (`git commit -s`). Semantic-release on main generates tags and changelog from commit types.

## License headers

Every source file requires an SPDX header:

```
# Copyright 2026 NVIDIA CORPORATION & AFFILIATES. All rights reserved.
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

CI checks this. Run `make add-license-headers` to fix.

## Go conventions

- Go modules use vendored dependencies (`-mod=vendor`).
- `auth-callout/` has its own `go.mod`, `.golangci.yml`, and `vendor/`.
- `local/mqtt-client/` and `local/mqttbs/` are separate Go modules.

## Helm chart conventions

- The main chart is `deploy/nats-event-bus/` with `auth-callout/deploy/` as a subchart dependency.
- Values follow the `global.eventBus.*` namespace for bus config, `auth-callout.*` for the subchart.
- Chart validation: `helm lint` + template rendering in CI.

## Fern docs

- Config: `fern/docs.yml` with `global-theme: nvidia`.
- Docs content lives in `docs/` (Markdown and MDX).
- Schema pages are generated from AsyncAPI specs — see `scripts/generate_asyncapi_docs.py`.
- CI runs `fern check`, `tools/check-docs-mdx`, and offline link checking.
- Do not upgrade the Fern CLI version without explicit instruction.

## CI

- GitHub Actions on NV-managed runners (`linux-amd64-cpu4`).
- Triggered on push to `main` and `pull-request/[0-9]+` branches (copy-pr-bot pattern).
- `pull_request` trigger is not used — the copy-pr-bot vets external PRs before CI runs.

## Security

- Never interpolate secrets into shell command strings — use env vars only.
- Validate all `workflow_dispatch` inputs before use.
- `.github/` changes require additional review per CODEOWNERS.

## NKey generation

See `deploy/scripts/generate-nkeys.sh --help` and `deploy/README.md` for usage and output layout.
